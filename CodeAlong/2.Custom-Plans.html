    <h1>What type of plan is right for you?</h1>

        <div class="auto-container">
    <h2 class="h2-auto">Endurance</h2>
    <p class="auto-paragraphs"><b>What is endurance in physical fitness?</b><br><br>
        Endurance activities, often referred to as aerobic, increase your breathing and heart rates. 
        These activities help keep you healthy, improve your fitness, and help you perform the tasks 
        you need to do every day. Endurance exercises improve the health of your heart, lungs, and circulatory system.<br>
        You should select an Endurance plan if you aim to improve your overall fitness or have a specific health goal that 
        is targeted by the following adaptations:<br><br>
        <b>Health of your heart, lungs, and circulatory system.</b><br>
        <b>Increases stamina and physical endurance for continuos aerobic activity</b><br>
        <b>Hypertrophy of the heart muscles</b><br>
        <b>Improved Circulatory response</b>
    </p>

<h2 class="h2-auto">Strength</h2>
<p class="auto-paragraphs">
    Strength and conditioning at the simplest form is the practical application of sports science to enhance movement quality.
     Its grounded in evidence-based research and physiology of exercise and anatomy. We all move and therefore we can all benefit 
     from a better quality of movement.<br><br>

    Strength and conditioning isnt hardcore beasting only for athletes, nor is it a particular Olympic lift, prowler push, or hill
     sprint drill. Whilst we might associate these moves with strength and conditioning, they are tools used to aid good strength and
      conditioning.<br><br>
    You should select a Strength plan if you aim to increase your muscular strength or you have a specific sporting goal
    based on strength development. 
    </p>


<h2 class="h2-auto">Balance</h2>
<p class="auto-paragraphs">
    Balance is the ability to control your body's position, whether stationary (i.e. a complex yoga pose) or while moving (e.g. skiing).
     Balance is a key component of fitness, along with strength, endurance, and flexibility. There are various ways to perform balance exercises.<br><br>
     Many people think of balance as something you have or dont, but balance can be trained for and developed just like any other element you can read about on this page.<br><br>
     You should select the Balance plan if you want to maintain or increase your current mobility. This can also be used as a beginner course for further development, i.e
     moving into a strength based program. 
    
    </p>

<h2 class="h2-auto">Flexibility</h2>
<p class="auto-paragraphs">
    Flexibility is the ability of a joint or series of joints to move through an unrestricted, pain free range of motion. Although flexibility varies widely from person to 
    person, minimum ranges are necessary for maintaining joint and total body health.<br><br>
    What is flexibility exercise?
Flexibility exercises are activities that improve the ability of a joint to maintain the movement necessary for carrying out daily tasks and physical activity. Examples of
 flexibility activities include: <b>stretching, yoga, tai chi.</b><br><br>
 You should select the Flexibility program if your goals are to increase your range of motion or as a further development of the Balance Program.
